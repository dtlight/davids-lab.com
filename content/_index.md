**Hello** 👋🏾

This is my personal site (built with Hugo PaperMod) to demonstrate and blog about some of the things I'm currently doing which involves automating things around the house wherever possible (thank you [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)) or tinkering with my [home lab](https://github.com/dtlight/homelab). As a platform engineer with 5 years of industry experience, this project gave me the opportunity to bring together what I’ve learnt over the years and progress my professional development exploring new things.

My Kubernetes Home Lab cluster currently consists of two control plane nodes and two worker nodes. HomeAssistant controls some of my devices (garden sprinklers, lights, cameras, heating) and Prometheus gathers metrics (temperature, water and energy consumption) which are displayed on my grafana dashboards. 

My hobbies & interests beyond the world of tech (in no particular order):
- Home DIY (electrics, plumbing and carpentry)
- Chess
- Running
- Badminton
- Scuba diving (PADI certified ✅)
- Skiing

**Thanks for visiting!**
